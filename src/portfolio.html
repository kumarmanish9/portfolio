    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Manish, a passionate Java Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA), and my journey in software development has been focused on leveraging the power of Java for building scalable, high-performance web applications.

            With expertise in Java for backend development, combined with a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for frontend development, I am committed to creating intuitive and efficient user experiences. My projects often involve working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and I’m skilled in using frameworks like Spring Boot and Spring MVC to build secure, robust applications.
            
            I am driven by the challenges of solving complex problems and continuously improving my technical skills. Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience in RESTful API development, UI/UX design, and working with Version Control Systems like Git.
            
            Apart from my technical work, I’m always looking to enhance my skills in cloud computing, DevOps practices, and microservices architecture. I enjoy collaborating with teams, learning new technologies, and staying up to date with the latest trends in software development.
            
            When I’m not coding, I love improving my physical fitness through calisthenics, exploring new tech, and taking on challenges that help me grow both as a developer and as an individual.
            
            I’m always excited to work on innovative projects, contribute to open-source communities, and connect with like-minded professionals in the tech world.
